"""
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm
in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared
and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as
its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where
n is the number of items.
